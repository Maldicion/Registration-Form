                Businesshike.in may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
                a report on

            </p>
            <p>Businesshike.in also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)

                Businesshike.in only

                discloses
                personally-identifying information as described below.
